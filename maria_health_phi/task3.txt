3. Describe the complexity of your program, and how it behaves as the value of X
increases.

Answer:
The initial 2 numbers of the sequence is almost constant, (0 and 1)
therefore we can define these two numbers as a given for the equation.
variable x is the nth term of the sequence.
For loop is used to start the sequence from 1 up to the nth sequence to print the fibonacci numbers

to handle the condition of printing "Maria", "Health", "Maria Health" if nth term is multiple or 3, 5, and both respectively,
i used modulo (%).

so if x = 15n
(15 % 3) will return no remainder, therefore it is a multiple of 3 which will print "Maria"
(15 % 5) will return no remainder, therefore it is a multiple of 5 which will print "Health"
the number is a multiple of both so it will print "Maria Healt"


var num1 is = Xn-2
var num2 is = Xn-1
